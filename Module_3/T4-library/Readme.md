**Objective:** Practice using containers to implement classes

In this exercise, you are required to implement three classes.

- **Book** which holds information about a book
- **Customer** which holds information about a customer book loans
- **Library** which collects together books and customers 

You will need to start from finishing the definitions in the header files
according to the instructions in the comments, and then implement the functions
in the source code files. 

> **NOTE**
>
>    Header files have `hpp` extension, and source code files have `cpp` extension.

The tests for `Customer` and `Library` classes require full points from 
`Book` class tests and 
`Library` tests requires full points from `Customer` tests. Therefore, the
recommended implementation order is 

1. `Book`, 
2. `Customer`, and then 
3. `Library`. 

Getter functions are also required to get full points for completing the tests. 

> **IMPORTANT**
> 
>    Note that you will still need to at least have dummy declarations and 
     definitions for the methods to be able to compile your program. 
>    
>    You could also test each class by yourself by modifying the 
    `main` function in the template. In this case, you do not need
    dummy definitions for unimplemented methods.
