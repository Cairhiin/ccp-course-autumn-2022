# First task
In  this exercise you are required to 
1. test the interactive code blocks.
2. Copy the code in the interactive code block into the provided template file `main.c`.
3. Put a breakpoint at line `int a;`.
4. Single step 3 lines, and check the value of variable `a`.
5. Then, single step 2 more lines, and again check the value of `a`.
6. Continue execution till debugging is terminated (after `return 0;` line).
7. Submit your implementation for grading by
- Stage `main.c`.
     ``` 
     git stage *
     ```
     or 
     ```
     git add *
     ```
     or 
     ```
     git stage Module_1/src/main.c
     ```
