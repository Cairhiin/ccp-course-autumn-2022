/**
 * \brief class Dragon is an abstract class that describes a dragon.
 *
 * Each Dragon object has a name (string), age (size_t), size (size_t) and a
 * list of Treasure objects that the Dragon has hoarded.
 *
 * The class has the following protected members, which means they are
 * accessible to classes which inherit this class: name (std::string), age
 * (size_t), size (size_t), treasures (std::list<Treasure>).
 *
 * Functions:
 *
 * The constructor takes the Dragon's name (const std::string&), age (size_t)
 * and size (size_t) as a parameter and intializes them to the parameter values.
 *
 * Destructor: Think about how it should be implemented!
 *
 * GetName: the function returns a constant reference to the Dragon's name and
 * takes no parameters. This function does not change the state of the Dragon
 * object, i.e. the function should be const.
 *
 * GetAge: the function returns the Dragon's age as a size_t and takes no
 * parameters. This function does not change the state of the Dragon object,
 * i.e. the function should be const.
 *
 * GetSize: the function returns the Dragon's size as a size_t and takes no
 * parameters. This function does not change the state of the Dragon object,
 * i.e. the function should be const.
 *
 * GetTreasures: the function returns a constant reference to the Dragon's
 * treasures list and takes no parameters. This function does not change the
 * state of the Dragon object, i.e. the function should be const.
 *
 * Eat: a pure virtual function, which returns nothing and takes a reference to
 * a list of Food objects as a parameter.
 *
 * Hoard: a pure virtual function, which returns nothing and takes a reference
 * to a list of Treasure objects as a parameter.

 * A Dragon should be printed to the parameter ostream in the following format:
Dragon named: <Dragon's name>, age: <Dragon's age>, size: <Dragon's size>\n
Treasures:\n
<First Treasure's name in the Dragon's treasures list>\n
<Second Treasure's name in the Dragon's treasures list>\n
...
<Last Treasure's name in the Dragon's treasures list>\n

 * NOTE: The dragons in the dragon list are printed in the same format as the
overloaded
 *       << stream operator for Dragons prints them. Also note that there is an
additional
 *       end line character after each dragon except for the last one.
 * \param os reference to the output stream to which the information is printed
(ostream&).
 * \param cave the Dragon whose information should be printed (const Dragon&).
 *
 * \return The output stream given as one of the arguments.
