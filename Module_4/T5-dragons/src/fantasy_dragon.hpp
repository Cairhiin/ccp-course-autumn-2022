/**
 * \brief TODO: class FantasyDragon describes a fantasy dragon. Inherits from
 * class Dragon.
 *
 * Public members of Dragon should be public in FantasyDragon as well.
 *
 * Functions:
 *
 * The constructor takes the dragon's name (const std::string&), age (size_t)
and
 * size (size_t) as a parameter and initialises them to the parameter values.
 *
 * Eat: an override of Dragon's Eat.
 *  FantasyDragons only eat Food whose type is either People or PeopleFood.
 *  Each eaten Food item increases the dragon's size by one.
 *
 *  The food that the dragon eats is removed from the parameter food list and
 *  each time the dragon feasts upon something you should print information of
 *  the Food that is being eaten to standard output in the following format:
Fantasy dragon ate: <Food's name>\n
 *
 *  The food should be eaten in the order from the list's beginning to end.
 *
 * Hoard: an override of Dragon's Hoard.
 *  FantasyDragons hoard only Treasures whose type is Jewellery. Each hoarded
 *  treasure is added to the dragon's treasure list and is removed from
 *  the parameter treasure list.
 *
 *  Each time the FantasyDragon hoards an item you should print information
about the hoarded
 *  item to standard output in the following format:
Fantasy dragon received: <Treasure's name>\n
 *
 *  The treasures should be received in the order from the list's beginning to
end.
